The user can also claim his/her invested amount and profit at any point of time by following certain steps. We will also be providing a statistical view of the profit the user might get after scheduled time.

Operating System - Windows 8 or above.
Software: Python, Ganache GUI, PostgreSQL

Ganache is a personal blockchain provided by the Truffle suite. Ganache can be used to set up a personal Ethereum blockchain suitable for testing and deploying Smart Contracts or dApps. Ganache tool comes in two flavours - a CLI (Command Line Interface) and a GUI (Graphical User Interface). It provides the user options to either start a new project or to get a Quickstart which will provide the user with 10 Ethereum wallet addresses with 100 Ethers in each.
